<H4>Overview</H4>

<P>
This page documents potential enhancements to PortAudio which have been 
suggested, but not yet developed into concrete proposals. Enhancements listed
here may be considered for future versions of PortAudio but no guarantees are
made about when or if these enhancements will be adopted.
</P>


<H4>Standard Method for Retrieving Implementation-specific PortAudio Entry Points</H4>

<P>
Some PortAudio implementations (such as the V19 ASIO version) define 
additional functions which extend the PortAudio API. When PortAudio is dynamically linked
it may be desirable to retrieve pointers to these functions using a 
standard interface. This could be implemented in a number of ways.
</P>


<H4>Method for Retrieving Actual Callback Buffer Size</H4>

<P>
In V19, using paFramesPerBufferUnspecified (0) for the framesPerBuffer parameter to Pa_OpenStream() is recommended so that PortAudio uses an optimal (and possibly varying) number of frames. Some clients could benefit from being able to discover what this buffer size, or what the range of possible buffer sizes is. This could be handled by adding an additional field to PaStreamInfo called bufferSize, which is the callback buffer size in frames, or 0 if the buffer size is variable or unknown. Another possibility is to have both a minBufferSize and maxBufferSize field.
