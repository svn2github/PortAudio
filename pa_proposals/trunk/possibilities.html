<H4>Overview</H4>

<P>
This page documents potential enhancements to PortAudio which have been 
suggested, but not yet developed into concrete proposals. Enhancements listed
here may be considered for future versions of PortAudio but no guarantees are
made about when or if these enhancements will be adopted.
</P>


<H4>Standard Method for Retrieving Implementation-specific PortAudio Entry Points</H4>

<P>
Some PortAudio implementations (such as the V19 ASIO version) define 
additional functions which extend the PortAudio API. When PortAudio is dynamically linked
it may be desirable to retrieve pointers to these functions using a 
standard interface. This could be implemented in a number of ways.
