<H1>017 - Method for Retrieving Actual Stream Sample Rate</H1>

<P>Updated: October 22, 2002 </P>

<H4>Status</H4>

<P>This proposals is open for discussion.</P>

<H4>Background</H4>

<P>
In some environments, the hardware sample rate may only approximate the well-known rate (such as 44.1khz) at which it is supposed to operate. Implementations of Pa_OpenStream() and Pa_OpenDeafaultStream() may choose to open the stream with such a sample rate, even if it does not exactly match the user's request. If this occurs, there is currently (V18) no way for the client to discover the actual sample rate at which the stream operates, even if this information is provided by the host API.
</P>

<H4>Proposal</H4>

<P>
Add a function to retrieve the actual sample rate of the stream:
</P>

<PRE>
/** Retrieve the actual sample rate of a stream. In cases where the hardware 
 sample rate is inaccurate and PortAudio is aware of it, the return value 
 may be different from the sample rate passed to Pa_OpenStream(). 
 If information about the actual hardware sample rate is not available, 
 the sample rate passed to Pa_OpenStream() will be returned.

 @param stream A pointer to a valid PortAudio stream.

 @return The actual sampling rate of the stream, or zero (0) if an error 
 occured.
*/
double Pa_GetStreamSamplingRate( PaStream *stream );
</PRE>

<H4>Impact Analysis</H4>

<P>
This proposal makes additional information about a stream available to clients and does not effect existing client code.
</P>
