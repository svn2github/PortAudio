<H3>Proposed Enhancements to PortAudio API</H3>
<H1>009 - Handling of Host API Specific Error Codes</H1>
</CENTER>

<A href="http://www.portaudio.com/">PortAudio Home Page</A></P>
<P>Updated: July 23, 2002 </P>

<H4>Status</H4>

<P>
Although this proposal is sufficiently well defined to be implemented immediately it requries further discussion. The possibility of extending the scope of this proposal has been discussed in this thread: <A HREF="http://techweb.rfa.org/pipermail/portaudio/2002-January/000358.html">http://techweb.rfa.org/pipermail/portaudio/2002-January/000358.html</A> Specifically, the removal of paHostError and Pa_GetHostError() seems to be the only way to provide a truly portable error reporting mechanism.
</P>

<H4>Background</H4>

<P>
Currently the PaHostError error code is used to notify clients that a platform-specific error condition occurred. This is considered ambiguous and difficult to work with. Specifically, it requires clients to poll the Pa_GetHostError() function to diagnose the
error condition, which in turn introduces dependencies on platform-specific error systems.
</P>

<H4>Proposal</H4>

<P>
PortAudio should seek to avoid returning the ambiguous paHostError error code, and instead translate to portable PortAudio error codes. In the case of the pa_win_mme implementation this means translating the following MME error codes:
</P>

<P>
MMSYSERR_ALLOCATED to paDeviceBusy (new) <BR>
MMSYSERR_BADDEVICEID to paInvalidDeviceId (already defined) <BR>
MMSYSERR_NODRIVER to paDriverMissing (new) <BR>
MMSYSERR_NOMEM to paInsufficientMemory (already defined) <BR>
WAVERR_BADFORMAT to paSampleFormatNotSupported (already defined) 
</P>

<H4>Discussion</H4>

<P>It is suggested that all implementations should be audited for their use of PaHostError.</P>

<P>
There was some concern about polluting the PortAudio error code namespace with platform-specific error codes, and of the potential overhead of including platform specific error strings on other platforms. Another suggestion has been to add a Pa_GetHostErrorText() function.
</P>

<P>
If all error codes are mapped to PortAudio error codes do we need a PaHostError code and the Pa_GetHostErrorCode() function?
</P>

<P>
A suggestion has been made to extend Pa_GetErrorText() so that it retrieved host API specific error strings when a host error occurs.</P>

<H4>Impact Analysis</H4>

<P>
This proposal improves the quality of PortAudio diagnostics. Client code that depends on paHostError code to flag certain conditions may be effected.
</P>
