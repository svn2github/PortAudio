<H3>Proposed Enhancements to PortAudio API</H3>
<H1>012 - Additional Pa_Terminate() Behavior</H1>
</CENTER>

<P><A href="index.html">Enhancement Proposals Index</A>,

<P>Updated: July 23, 2002 </P>

<H4>Status</H4>

<P>This proposal is sufficiently well defined to be implemented and has been implemented in v19-devel.</P>

<H4>Background</H4>

<P>
Some host APIs (eg ASIO, MME and DirectSound under Windows NT) can require a reboot to free devices when they are not closed properly (due to a program not calling Pa_Close() either in error, or due to a crash.) As a quality of implementation issue PortAudio should seek to avoid such circumstances.
</P>

<H4>Proposal</H4>

<P>The definition of Pa_Terminate() should be extended as follows:</P>

<PRE>
/*
    Pa_Terminate() is the library termination function - call this after 
    using the library. This function deallocates all resources allocated 
    by PortAudio since it was initializied using Pa_Initialize(). Any open 
    PortAudioStreams are closed.

    Pa_Terminate() MUST be called before exiting a program which 
    uses PortAudio. Failure to do so may result in serious resource 
    leaks, such as audio devices not being available until the next reboot.
*/
PaError Pa_Terminate( void );
</PRE>

<H4>Implementation Notes</H4>

<P>
One possible implementation strategy would be to add a "next" member to the internal stream data structure thus making it a linked list node, which could be linked into a list of all open streams.
</P>

<H4>Discussion</H4>

<P>
Some concerns have been raised about the overhead involved in PortAudio having to keep track of which streams are currently open.
</P>

<P>
There has been some discussion about the behavior of nesting multiple calls to Pa_Initialize() and Pa_Terminate() - there is no intention of changing the current behaviour, which is that PortAudio has two states: "Initialized" and "Uninitialized" - in the Initialized state, Pa_Initialize() does nothing and returns an error, in the Uninitialized state Pa_Terminate() does nothing and returns an error.
[META]This assertion needs to be checked against the v19-devel implementation.[/META]
</P>

<H4>Impact Analysis</H4>

<P>
This proposal changes the termination behaviour of PortAudio to reduce the likelihood of resource leaks.</P>

<P>
On Windows, the new Pa_Terminate() behaviour would allow users who want full protection against device leakage to install a global Win32 exception handler that calls Pa_Terminate() before exiting when a crash occurs. Similar techniques (using SIGNAL handlers perhaps?) may be possible on other platforms where necessary.
</P>
